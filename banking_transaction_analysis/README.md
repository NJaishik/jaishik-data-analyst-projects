# Banking Transaction Analysis (Python + SQL + Excel)

This project simulates a banking environment with **10,000 financial transactions** across branches, transaction types, and statuses.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze transaction failures  
- Identify high-risk patterns (timeouts, network issues)  
- Perform EDA using Pandas  
- Visualize trends (daily transaction counts)  
- Use SQL-style grouping/filtering logic  

---

## Files Included
- `bank_transactions.csv` — Synthetic dataset  
- `analysis_banking.py` — Python EDA script  
- `transactions_per_day.png` — Generated plot  
- `LICENSE.txt`  
- This README

---

## Insights Generated
- Daily transaction volume trends  
- Failure distribution with error codes  
- Branch-wise and transaction-type patterns  
- Outlier detection in transaction amounts
